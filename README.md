# Sudoku-Windows
My first programming project - a simple sudoku game for windows written in a single, slightly messy python script.
Running the program will create a savefile folder in the same directory as the script.

Requirements:
- 1000 x 690 minimum screen resolution.
- The pygame library: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted.
- The images and textfiles in this repository.
